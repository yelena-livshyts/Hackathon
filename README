(*)task 1:
To run the task from the command line use classifier.py <labels_for_test_file.csv>,
i.e. you only need to give our python file the labels for the test.
Than, to use your evaluation file use our next files:
gold_labels_processed.csv - processed labels after recieved from CL, will be created after running regression.py
predictions.csv

(*)task 2:
To run the task from the command line use regression.py <labels_for_test_file.csv>,

Than, to use your evaluation file use our next files:
gold_labels_processed.csv - processed labels after recieved from CL, will be created after running regression.py
