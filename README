To run the task from the command line use knn_model.py <labels_for_test_file.csv>,
i.e. you only need to give our python file the labels for the test.
Than, to use your evaluation file use our next files:
gold_labels_processed.csv - processed labels after recieved from CL, will be created after running regression.py
predictions.csv
